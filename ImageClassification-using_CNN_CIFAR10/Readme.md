- Python 🐍
- Jupyter Notebook 📓
- TensorFlow 🔥
- Keras 📦
- NumPy 🔢
- Matplotlib 📈
- CIFAR-10 Dataset 📚

## 🚀 Installation
To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/image-classification-cnn-cifar10.git
   cd image-classification-cnn-cifar10
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   python -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `env\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install the required packages:**
