## 🚀 Installation
To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/random-forest-project.git
   cd random-forest-project
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   python -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `env\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install the required packages:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## 📖 Usage
Open the Jupyter Notebook to explore the data analysis and model training steps:
```bash
jupyter notebook Random_Forest.ipynb
```
