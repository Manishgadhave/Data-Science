## 🌟 Overview
This project aims to accurately detect facial landmarks using machine learning techniques. The model identifies key points on the face, such as the eyes, nose, mouth, and jawline, which can be used for various applications like face recognition, emotion detection, and augmented reality.

## ✨ Features
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Facial landmark detection
- Visualization of facial landmarks
- Real-time face landmark detection

## 🛠️ Technologies
This project utilizes the following tools and technologies:
- Python 🐍
- Jupyter Notebook 📓
- OpenCV 🎥
- Dlib 🖼️
  
## 🚀 Installation
To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/face-landmark-detection.git
   cd face-landmark-detection
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   python -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `env\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install the required packages:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Download the `shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat` file:**
   Download the pre-trained facial landmark detector from [this link](http://dlib.net/files/shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat.bz2) and extract it into the project directory.

## 📖 Usage
Open the Jupyter Notebook to explore the data analysis and model training steps:
```bash
jupyter notebook Face_Landmark_Detection.ipynb
```

Run the cells in the notebook to preprocess the data, detect facial landmarks, and visualize the results.
