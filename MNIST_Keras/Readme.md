## 🌟 Overview
This project aims to develop a neural network model for classifying handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The dataset contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images of digits (0-9), and the goal is to correctly identify the digit in each image.

## ✨ Features
- Data loading and preprocessing
- Neural network model architecture
- Model training and evaluation
- Digit classification
- Visualization of results

## 🛠️ Technologies
This project utilizes the following tools and technologies:
- Python 🐍
- Jupyter Notebook 📓
- TensorFlow 🔥
- Keras 📦
- NumPy 🔢
- Matplotlib 📈
- MNIST Dataset 🔢

## 🚀 Installation
To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/mnist-digit-classification-keras.git
   cd mnist-digit-classification-keras
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   python -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `env\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install the required packages:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## 📖 Usage
Open the Jupyter Notebook to explore the data analysis and model training steps:
```bash
jupyter notebook MNIST_keras.ipynb
```

Run the cells in the notebook to preprocess the data, train the neural network model, and classify digits.
